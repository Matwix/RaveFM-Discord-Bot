# RaveFM Discord Bot

This is a discord bot designed for listening to the **RaveFM.LIVE** radio station, It has a simple purpose but please we don't mind if you decide to repurpose our bot :)

# How does it work?

This bot was coded in Discord.JS v12 and uses ffmpeg-binaries with @discordjs/opus to play the music.

* Step 2. Install FFMPEG Binaries from here https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html
* Step 3. Run `npm install` inside the project's directory to install all the packages required
* Step 4. Update the .env file with your bot's token
* Step 5. Run `npm run` to start the bot.
